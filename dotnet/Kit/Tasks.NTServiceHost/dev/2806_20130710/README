Welcome to this ppwcode project.

This project uses OpenWrap <http://www.openwrap.org/>.

Please verify that you have installed OpenWrap 2.x (beta), or else install it first.
See <https://projects.peopleware.be/confluence/x/DIISAQ> for more information.

To get up and running,

1) add the necessary remote repositories to OpenWrap.
   See <https://projects.peopleware.be/confluence/x/AIEiAQ> for details.
   This project needs
   * the PPWCode remote repository
2) execute "o update-wrap" from this directory
3) open the solution in "src/" in Visual Studio.

If 2) fails, delete the existing wraps directory from this project, and try again.


REMARKS:
The AppConfigGeneration project contains svn:externals links to a
private repository. The reason is that the AppConfigGeneration project
is used to automatically generate App.config configuration files
for specific deployment environments. We consider these settings private.
For our own sanity, we linked the configuration files to our own external
private subversion repository for now. When a better solution comes up,
we will change this.
