Welcome to this ppwcode project.

This project uses OpenWrap <http://www.openwrap.org/>.

Please verify that you have installed OpenWrap 2.x (beta), or else install it first.
See <https://projects.peopleware.be/confluence/x/DIISAQ> for more information.

To get up and running,

1) add the necessary remote repositories to OpenWrap.
   See <https://projects.peopleware.be/confluence/x/AIEiAQ> for details.
   This project needs
   * the PPWCode remote repository
   * some remote repository where there is a wrap for Microsoft.SharePoint.Client; chances are you will have to create this yourself, since we cannot distribute it.
2) execute "o update-wrap" from this directory
3) open the solution in "src/" in Visual Studio.

If 2) fails, delete the existing wraps directory from this project, and try again.
