This solution uses the tools from the SQLCLRProject 

http://sqlclrproject.codeplex.com/
This solution currently uses version version 2.6a.

SQLCLRProject is by Niels Berglund.
It is released under the Microsoft Public License.

Sadly, the source code was never uploaded.
This directory keeps a copy of the binaries
of the used version for save keeping.


Installation is described in the README file of the project.
We chose
  install_all.bat 2008 LH
as parameters on Windows 7, VS 2008,
in a command prompt, ran as administrator.

Installation of the templates fails this way.
NO SOLUTION YET.

After this, memory was corrupted.
VS started failing big time, even after restarting VS.

After a reboot, problems went away.
