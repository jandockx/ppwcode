Welcome to this ppwcode project.

This project uses OpenWrap <http://www.openwrap.org/>.

Please verify that you have installed OpenWrap, or else install it first.
See <https://projects.peopleware.be/confluence/x/DIISAQ> for more information.

To get up and running,

1) add the necessary remote repositories
2) execute "o update-wrap" from this directory
3) open the solution in "src/" in Visual Studio.


There is one small problem.
We can only get working the remote ppwcode repository in one way.
- Deploy at our local server
- Mount via webdav via netdrive, authenticated via our local uid
- use file:///... on the mounted drive as remote repo reference
