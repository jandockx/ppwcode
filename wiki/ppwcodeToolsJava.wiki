= Introduction =

This page discusses tooling used for ppwcode Java projects. The tools used for Java projects are an extension of the [ppwcodeTools general tools used].


= Details =

== Build ==

ppwcode projects use [http://maven.apache.org/ Maven 2] as the main development and build tool. You'd best install Maven 2 before you checkout the ppwcode code. It's easier that way :-).

== IDE ==

You can use any IDE you want. It doesn't matter, since we standardize on [http://maven.apache.org/ Maven 2]. Yet, be aware, that no IDE specific files should be add to svn (unless there is a very good reason, which is discussed at the developer list first).

== Other ==

A lot of other tools are used ([http://pmd.sourceforge.net/ PMD], [http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/ Checkstyle], ...), but these are not discussed here, since they are defined and configured in Maven 2 parent poms which we use. See there for more information.
