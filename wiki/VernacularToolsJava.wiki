#summary The vernacular of tools used in Java projects

= Introduction =

In this section we discuss which tools are used in Java software development projects in general (client projects, outside ppwcode). This section only discusses Java-specific tools. This is an extension on the [VernacularTools general section].

In general, the guidelines for [pwpcodeToolsJava ppwcode Java projects] apply to projects outside ppwcode too. Here, we only mention differences.


= Details =

There are no deviations from the ppwcode tooling guide at this time.
