#summary The vernacular of tools used in projects

= Introduction =

In this section we discuss which tools are used in software development projects in general (client projects, outside ppwcode). This is a general section. You should also refer to the specialized sections about tools used in [VernacularToolsJava Java projects], [VernacularToolsDotNet .net projects], and [VernacularToolsSql SQL projects].

In general, the guidelines for [pwpcodeTools ppwcode projects] apply to projects outside ppwcode too. Here, we only mention differences.


= Details =

There are no deviations from the ppwcode tooling guide at this time.
