= Introduction =

Projects should be clean and neat, certainly before they are released. But what does that mean, "clean and neat"? Here is a checklist (continuously growing).


= Subversion =

  * At the top level, there should be svn:ignore svn properties set for
    * eclipse project files (`.project`, `.classpath`, `.settings`)
    * the Maven 2 `target` directory


= Maven 2=

  * Projects should have a Maven 2 POM
  * The POM should contain all relevant developer and contributor information
