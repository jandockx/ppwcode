#summary Checklist for projects
#labels Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

Projects should be clean and neat, certainly before they are released. But what does that mean, "clean and neat"? Here is a checklist (continuously growing).


= Subversion =

  * At the top level, there should be svn:ignore svn properties set for
    * eclipse project files (`.project`, `.classpath`, `.settings`)
    * the Maven 2 `target` directory


= Maven 2=

  * Projects should have a Maven 2 POM
  * The POM should contain all relevant developer and contributor information, which is probably a delta with its parent pom


= LIcense =

  * All projects are released under the Apache License v2
  * All projects should have a LICENSE.txt file in their root. A copy of this file can be found in the root of the repo or at http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt.
  * A CLA should be in the possession of PeopleWare for all developers and contributors found in the POM and in the Subversion history.
