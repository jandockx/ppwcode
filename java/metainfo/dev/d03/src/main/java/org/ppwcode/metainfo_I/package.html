<p>Annotations to put meta-information into class files.</p>
<p>{@link org.ppwcode.metainfo_I.Copyright} holds structured copyright information.
  {@link org.ppwcode.metainfo_I.License} holds structured license information, for
  selected Open Source licenses. {@link org.ppwcode.metainfo_I.vcs}
  is a package that contains annotations to hold structured information for each
  file for Version Control Systems (<acronym title="Version Control System">VCS</acronym>).</p>
 <h3>Retention policy</h3>
<p>All annotations in this library should have retention policy {@link java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy.CLASS}.
  If we would use {@link java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME}, we could use reflection to access
  the meta information, at the cost of a little extra memory during runtime. That would be nice, yet,
  it would also have use consequences for all projects that use libraries that use the meta information.
  With a retention policy {@link java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME}, any project P using one
  or more libraries which employ ppwcode meta info, would have a runtime dependency on this library,
  although it would probably never be used at runtime. By making the retention policy
  {@link java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy.CLASS}, the meta information is embedded in the class files,
  i.e., the binaries, as intended, and libraries using ppwcode meta info will only have a compile
  time dependency on this library.</p>
