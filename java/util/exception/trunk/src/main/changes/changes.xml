    <release version="III v1.0" date="2008-10-??" description="split of from vernacular exception">
      <action dev="jandockx" type="add">
        First version of exception utility code. This is split off from the vernacular exception
        (which is the evolution of the older ppwcode exception framework). The reason is that
        this way we get less annoying dependencies. ProgrammingErrorHelpers and ExceptionHelpers
        have a much broader use than the rest.
