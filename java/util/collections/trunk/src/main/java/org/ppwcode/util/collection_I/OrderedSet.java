/**
 * <p>Set that keeps a user defined order (in contrast to a sorted set,
 *   where the order is defined algorithmically by a comparator). Elements
 *   have a position in an {@code OrderedSet}.</p>
 * <p>Based on <a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/jakarta/commons/proper/collections/branches/collections_jdk5_branch/src/java/org/apache/commons/collections/set/AbstractSerializableSetDecorator.java?view=markup">Apache Jakarta Commons SVN repository d.d. 2007/3/12</a>,
 *   by Stephen Colebourne and Henning P. Schmiedehausen.</p>
 *
 * @note This cannot be a {@link List}, sadly, for the dubious reason that the
 *       {@link List} contract says that {@link List#add(Object)} always returns
 *       {@code true}, and the {@link java.util.Collection} contract says that
 *       {@link java.util.Collection#add(Object)} returns {@code true} if the collection has
 *       changed. In a list, every {@code add} has a change effect (the element is
 *       added at the end of the list, possibly as a duplicate). In a list with
 *       set behavior, if the element is already in the list, it would move. This
 *       is also a change, except when the element to be added is already at the end:
 *       then nothing changes (no extra element and no move), so we need to return
 *       {@code false}. Arguably, the contract of {@code List} is too strong. The
 *       same reasoning applies to {@link #add(int, Object)}, {ATlink #addAll(int, java.util.Collection)} // TODO change this Javadoc when implemented
 *       and {@link #addAll(java.util.Collection)}.
 *
 * @note A method {@code boolean addAll(int index, Collection<? extends E> coll)}
 *       has no meaningful semantics in an ordered set or set list. Suppose we take
 *       the ordered set {1, 2, 3}, and we ask to add {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} at index 3?
 *       The result would have to something like {x, x, x, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, but we
 *       can't set any elements at the x's. Throwing an {@link IndexOutOfBoundsException}
 *       here is not the correct semantics either, or very difficult for the user
 *       to understand.
 *
 * @note Implementing classes should implement {@link #equals(Object)} so that it takes
 *       the order into account.
