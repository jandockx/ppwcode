<body>
  <p>Alternative implementation of serialization, using an annotation when the <code>transient</code> keyword cannot
    be used. Implement a protected method as follows in your hierarchy of classes you want to use this approach:</p>
  <pre>
    protected final Object writeReplace() throws NotSerializableException {
      return {@link org.ppwcode.util.reflect_I.serialization.SerializationHelpers#replace(java.io.Serializable) SerializationHelpers.replace(this)};
    }
  </pre>
  <p>All subclasses inherited this method, and thus this serialization approach. In the class in which you have defined
    this method, and all its subclasses, you can now use the annotation
    {@link org.ppwcode.util.reflect_I.serialization.DoNotSerialize} on instance variables that you do not want to
    serialize. On deserialization, these instance variables will have they initial value they have after using
    the default constructor. This approach used reflection to read and write in instance variables, indifferent
    of their accessibility settings.</p>
  <p>The rationale for this library is serialization in JPA based EJB applications. The technology probably has broader
    implementations though.</p>
  <p>In JPA and similar technologies, you can define relationships (and other properties) of persistent beans (or
    <dfn>entities</dfn>) to use <dfn>lazy loading</dfn>. Mostly this is done for downstream associations, most often
    to-many associations. When transporting a persistent object out of the application layer to a client layer, via RMI,
    it is serialized. It makes sense to not want to serialize the properties you have marked for lazy loading. In fact,
    when you do nothing, either the property is in fact loaded, making the lazy loading feature meaningless, or
    silly things happen with the property. In OpenJPA, e.g., (and probably in other technologies too), if you serialize
    a detached object, for which a to-many association has not been initialized, the collection property that expresses
    the to-many association ends up <code>null</code> after deserialization. This often is contrary to representation
    invariants for to-many associations. In other words, the implementation of the methods of the deserialized object
    is no longer guaranteed to be correct.</p>
  <p>It makes great sense to make all properties marked for lazy loading <code>transient</code>. However, in the JPA
    context at least, the keyword <code>transient</code> also has an effect on back end persistency. In the serialization
    specification it is stated that <code>transient</code> means that the property should not be persisted in any
    persistency context, not only in the context of serialization. Security reasons are cited as the main reason.
    See <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/serialization/spec/serial-arch.html#7231">the serialization
    specification, paragraph 1.13</a>. In other words, we cannot use <code>transient</code> to stop serialization
    of our lazily loaded properties.</p>
  <p>Luckily other ways of doing this are possible. We are looking however for a transparent, zero effort way of doing
    this. The <code>serialPersistentFields</code> approach is cumbersome: we have to remember to explicitly list
    all instance variables we do want serialized in all classes (while the default is still that almost all
    properties should be serialized). The <code>private void writeObject(ObjectOutputStream stream) throws IOException</code>
    approach requires an explicit method in every class, where we explicitly implement serialization ourselves of
    everything we want serialized. This is worse than then <code>serialPersistentFields</code> approach.
    The {@link java.io.Externalizable} approach works (see the experiments in the test code for this project) but
    has a major documented drawback, namely that the methods are <code>public</code>, and thus hardly transparent.</p>
  <p>The chosen <code>protected Object writeReplace() throws ObjectStreamException</code> approach is transparent,
    automatic and clean. However, there is a documented problem with loops in the object graph that is serialized.
    See the note to <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/serialization/spec/input.html#5903">paragraph 3.7
    in the serialization specification</a>. We believe that in the context of the rationale for this library, this
    is not a bad thing, as sending cyclic object graphs over the wire is probably a sign of bad design.</p>

  <h3>serialization of enums</h3>
  <p><strong>This serialization utility also tackles a long standing problem with serialization of <code>ennum</code>s.
    This workaround should be removed from this library once the issue is fixed.</strong>
    Google &quot;Can't deserialize enum&quot; to find a lot of references, e.g.,
    <a href="http://forums.sun.com/thread.jspa?threadID=5252746&tstart=1">on the Sun forums</a>, and
    <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=229431">on developerWorks</a>.</p>
  <p>The problem seems to be that there is a long standing bug in the ORB included in the JRE / JDK (client-side
    of RMI-IIOP) when deserializing enums. When the client side is the IBM VM, there is no problem. The problem
    seems to exist in JDK 5 up until the last JDK 6 version today (4 dec 2008).</p>
  <p>In this library, for persistent beans, we "recognize" enum properties, and serialize them in a custom way.
    The support is general, and can be applied in other places if you wish.</p>
