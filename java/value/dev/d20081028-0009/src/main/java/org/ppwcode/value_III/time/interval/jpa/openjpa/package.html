    <p>OpenJPA value handlers for effective time intervals.</p>
    <p>Sadly, JPA as a standard does not support &quot;user types&quot;
      or &quot;custom types&quot; or &quot;value types&quot; as any
      reasonable other technology does, from Hibernate over OpenJPA, but
      also including Struts, JSF, dwr, json-lib, and many, many others.
      Therefor, we introduce the OpenJPA solution, which can be used in OpenJPA
      contexts, and other solutions for other contexts.</p>
