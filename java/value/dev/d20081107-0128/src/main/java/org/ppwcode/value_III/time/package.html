    <p>Time is dangerously and treacherously difficult to reason about.
      The classes supported by the Java SE API are a good start, but don't fully
      do the subject justice. In this package and its sub packages we try to offer
      some help.</p>
    <p>{@link org.ppwcode.value_III.time.DateHelpers} offers some methods that are
      often useful when working with {@link java.util.Date}. We want to continue working
      with {@link java.util.Date}, because there is a lot of code out there that does
      deal with {@link java.util.Date} that aids already a lot.</p>
    <p>In this structure, we want to make an explicit difference between
      <dfn>points in time</dfn>, for which we use {@link java.util.Date},
      <dfn>time intervals</dfn> and <dfn>time durations</dfn>.</p>
    <p>Time intervals and reasoning with time intervals is a very complex subject
      matter. Support for working with time intervals is based around
      Allen's Interval Algebra, and gathered in {@link org.ppwcode.value_III.time.interval}.
      {@link org.ppwcode.value_III.time.Duration} is the abstraction you can use
      when working with time durations.</p>

    <h3 id="java.sql.Date">On {@link java.sql.Date}</h3>
    <p>It doesn't make much sense to use {@link java.sql.Date} in your code, since it actually is a
      {@link java.util.Date}, wrapping an object around the milliseconds since
      {@link org.ppwcode.value_III.time.DateHelpers#EPOCH}. It is used by SQL drivers to return a
      value that was stored as SQL <code>DATE</code>. If returned by
      {@link java.sql.ResultSet#getDate(String, java.util.Calendar)} or
      {@link java.sql.ResultSet#getDate(int, java.util.Calendar)}, the time zone of the
      {@link java.util.Calendar} argument is used
      to determine how to zero the intraday time details. If returned by
      {@link java.sql.ResultSet#getDate(String)} or {@link java.sql.ResultSet#getDate(int)},
      the {@link java.util.TimeZone#getDefault()
      default time zone} is used for that, which depends mostly on your operating system settings, and
      thus is not really portable. Apart from the fact that a {@link java.sql.Date} thus expresses,
      <em>by its use</em> (and no other constrained is programmed into it), midnight in <em>a</em> time zone,
      and the fact that some methods are blocked from operation (which are deprecated), there is
      no functional difference whatsoever between {@link java.sql.Date} and {@link java.util.Date}.
      Notably, it is totally possible to create a {@link java.sql.Date} for any possible point in time,
      given the milliseconds since {@link #EPOCH} of that time. E.g., nothing is holding you, are another
      programmer back from creating a {@link java.sql.Date} as:</p>
    <pre>
      GregorianCalendar gc = new GregorianCalendar(2008, 10, 4, 9, 53, 34, 567);
      gc.setTimeZone(TimeZone.getTimeZone("Europe/Brussels"));
      long millis = gc.getTimeInMillis();
      java.sql.Date result = new java.sql.Date(millis);
   </pre>
   <p>The resulting {@link java.sql.Date} is not at midnight in any time zone of practical use. (You
      can of course devise a time zone in which it is.)</p>
   <p>The actual date represented by a {@link java.sql.Date} depends on the time zone in which you
      evaluate it, e.g., with a {@link DateFormat}:</p>
   <pre>
      java.sql.Date today = DateHelpers.sqlDayDate(new Date(), UTC);
      TimeZone la = TimeZone.getTimeZone("America/Los_Angeles");
      TimeZone moscow = TimeZone.getTimeZone("Europe/Moscow");
      DateFormat df = DateFormat.getDateInstance(FULL);
      df.setTimeZone(la);
      System.out.println(df.format(today));
      df.setTimeZone(moscow);
      System.out.println(df.format(today));
   </pre>
   <p>The two println's will always show a different result.</p>
