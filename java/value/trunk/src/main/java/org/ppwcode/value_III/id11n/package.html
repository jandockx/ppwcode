<p><strong>Id11n</strong> or <strong>identification</strong> is a package that gathers general
  interfaces and supporting code for value types that are used as identifiers of objects in
  reality. Examples are identifiers of persons, organizations, computers, goods for sale,
  etcetera. Note that this comes very close to the concept of a {@link java.net.URI Uniform Resource Identifier}, see <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt">RFC 2369</a>.</p>
<p>Identifiers for objects in reality have a long history. There are a number of reasons for their use:</p>
<ul>
  <li>to uniquely identify a certain real world object in an abstract context, either in a persistent storage (a classic 1890's paper file), or in communication</li>
  <li>as a way to link data in different persistent storages together, when the data concerns a common real world object or a more abstract concept</li>
  <li>as a way to find data in a persistent storage; for this, such identifiers are often structured in some way, or can be ordered</li>
</ul>
<p>Without a doubt, there are much more reasons to be listed for the use of identifiers. Note that certainly the first 2 reasons cited above are akin to the concept of
  <dfn>reference semantics</dfn> or <dfn>handles</dfn> as known in computer science. Other needs are comparable to why we use <dfn>primary keys</dfn> in databases.</p>
<p>A big difference with the era of computers is, that although we need some form of identification internally, there is less need to expose the internal, technical identifiers
  to the end user. Before the advent of computers and powerful processors, it was necessary for people to work with the identifiers themselves. With computers and databases,
  and powerful search algorithms, in this day and age, humans can make do with a description of the real world object to have the computer find the correct files.
  E.g., a name, city, district, job description, ..., might suffice to quickly find the data concerning a certain person, without the need for a formalized identifier.
  Such an approach is much more intuitive than having the end user type in un-human strings.</p>
<p>Yet, for historical reasons, and to be able to link data in different persistent storages, in different organizations, to the same real world object, most business
  applications still have to deal with this identifiers in some way. We observe that most identifier types follow a more or less common scheme, and have syntactic
  limitations. Therefore, it is interesting to create a code base that supports such identifiers as much as possible, and implements the identifiers in common use
  once and for all, even if we succeed in hiding them from the end user.</p>
<h3>Practical requirements for the code</h3>
<p>There are many existing schemes for identification. Sadly, it is difficult to find existing implementations in code that express these schemes. This project attempts to
  offer such code, finished. For this, we take a highly practical point of view: we want code that works out of the box, that encapsulates all the knowledge and behavior
  for a given identification scheme, for what we need in day to day projects. This encompasses internal code (reasoning, in RAM), persistence (representation of the identifier
  in a database), and user interaction (UI components for end users to see and input identifiers). In each version, we limit ourselves to practical subsets we need now.
  Over time, support may grow broader.</p>
<p>The practical use of identifiers is necessary, but quite limited:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The main feature of an identifier is that it must be possible to express <dfn>equality</dfn>. Do 2 instances of an identifier express the same identifier?
    Identifiers never exist in isolation. They are always the property of a larger set of data. Via identifier equality, we express that 2 sets of data concern
    the same real world object. Furthermore, equality suffices for finding sets of data for a given real world object of which the identifier is known.</li>
  <li>Most identifier schemes are alpha-numeric, but have a definition of well-formedness. Our code should at least offer support to validate identifiers
    with respect to well-formedness, and not allow the existence of instances that are not well-formed.</li>
  <li>Identifier schemes have a limited applicability. Different schemes exist for different types of real world objects. Our code must make it possible to restrict
    of the use of a certain scheme to its applicable objects.</li>
  <li>Many identifier schemes exist for a given type of real world object. Anybody can invent a scheme, and anybody surely has over the past 1000 years or more.
    We must support the possibility to use different schemes for a given type of real world object, while the use is still restricted to schemes applicable
    for that given type of real world object.</li>
  <li>Furthermore, in general, it must be possible to use a collection of applicable identifiers for a given type of real world objects. Each different scheme
    is invented by a different authority, and / or for a different context. It is often necessary in our projects to link a set of data through an identifier
    in many different contexts, that each requires its own identifier scheme. Furthermore, it must be possible for such a collection to be open, so that
    identifiers of new applicable schemes can be added when they become available without large code changes. And on the other hand, it must also be possible
    to constrain such a collection to not accept particular applicable schemes, or to require at least elements of one or n particular applicable schemes.</li>
  <li>From each identifier instance, in all circumstances, it must be possible to derive the scheme of which it is an instance. In user interfaces, this requirement
    can be weakened from &quot;derive&quot; to &quot;know&quot;: if the property the user is shown or asked to interact with is constrained to one specific
    identifier scheme, the user can be told via meta-information (label) what type is to be expected, and it is not necessary to demand of the end user to
    manually express the scheme. In RAM and persistence storage however, because of the dynamic nature of the world we live in, an identifier should always
    carry its type: we know from experience that scheme change and are added, and that it is extremely often a question which scheme a certain identifier expresses.
    Extreme use cases must be presented to justify not doing this for reasons of performance, memory use or disk use.</li>
  <li>The different types of identifier schemes, for a given applicability, must be enumerated. Since we do not endeavour to support all existing schemes, this
    enumeration should be limited to those schemes that are supported.</li>
  <li>The technology used to enumerate the supported identifier schemes should be dynamic. This must make it possible for users of a library of identifier schemes
    to add support for new schemes outside the library, and use it in his application. The need for enumeration comes in the first place from a UI concern: when
    an end user can add an identifier to a polymorph collection, he needs a UI mechanism such as a set of radio buttons or a combo box to select the type. This
    requires an enumeration of supported types. Furthermore, such an enumeration can be used to implement limitations to the accepted schemes as required above.
    Furthermore, such an enumeration can be used to implement factory code.</li>
  <li>A reference should be kept, mainly for developers, to a formal description of the identifier scheme.</li>
</ul>
<p>An ordering for identifiers sometimes exists, but is largely irrelevant in our scope. Orderings for identifiers were introduced historically for retrieval of data sets
  by humans in large data collections. Computers do that for us now transparently (also using an ordering, but not necessarily a semantically meaningful ordering; the
  possible orderings of the underlying primitive representation suffices).</p>
<p>The internal structure of an identifier scheme expresses sometimes embedded semantics. Properties of the real world object an identifier refers to are sometimes
  embedded in the identifier. For us, this is in general irrelevant. We treat identifiers as pseudo keys, and not as natural keys. The implementation might offer
  methods that expose properties derived from the internal structure of an identifier, but this is not a requirement. E.g., a first version does not need to offer
  this feature, but it can be added in later versions. In any case, if such support is offered, in every case known to this writer, the information embedded in an
  identifier can only be seen as indicative or probable. In every case known to this writer, when an identifier embeds semantic information about the real world
  object the identifier refers to, there are exceptions to the rule. Thus, in general, such information should be mistrusted, and only used as a heuristic replacement
  for missing information, or a default, never as authoritative information.</p>
<p>The internal structure of an identifier scheme might be interesting internally for reasons of well-formedness validation or the extraction of semantic information,
  but is irrelevant for use of the identifier in the computer. It should be encapsulated and hidden. Only in the user interface might it be interesting to expose
  commonly known internal structure to ease end user interaction. There is no reason in general to expose the structure in persistent storage.</p>
<h3>Actual scope of the code</h3>
<p>In this version, we accept the following limitations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>all identifiers are alpha-numeric</li>
  <li>all identifiers will be stored as String / VARCHAR</li>
</ul>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>This package contains the framework and general support code for identifiers. Actual concrete implementations of concrete identifier schemes for concrete
  applicability domains are created in other packages aimed at the applicability domain. This text sketches the general design of this code. Detailed information
  is to be found in the Javdoc of the particular classes and interfaces.</p>
<p>Identifiers will be implemented as {@link org.ppwcode.vernacular.value_III.ImmutableValue immutable values}. Each scheme we support will be represented by a separate
  (final Java) class, encapsulating the notion of equality and well-formedness. In this way, the language's strong typing can be used to limit the applicability of a
  certain scheme, or, that is, the closest we can get, developers can expressly limit the identifier scheme they want to accept for a given property by declaring
  the appropriate static identifier type for the property.</p>
<p>Apart from the actual concrete classes expressing one concrete identifier scheme, interface hierarchies will be used to make polymorph use of several identifier
  schemes possible, as well in a simple property, as in a multi-valued property. Hierarchies can exist per type of real world objects, per issuing authority, etcetera.
  Multiple inheritance can be applied in this interface hierarchy freely.</p>
<p>The concrete identifier instances will hold a String instance variable, which will be persisted in to a VARCHAR field, that expresses the identifier. This is
  the programmatic representation, and it will hold no structure or optional separator characters.</p>
<p>Concrete identifier classes will feature a constructor that takes a complete identifier String as input. A default constructor is not mandatory, and should only be
  added if there is a true default element in the collection of identifiers allowed by the scheme. Other constructors that expose the possible internal structure of
  the identifier may be added if applicable.</p>
<p>The {@link Object#toString()} method of the identifier types will return the programmatic representation of the identifier instance, including an identification
  of the scheme.</p>
<p>Equality is implemented depending on the semantics of the identifier scheme (it is possible that schemes define equivalency beyond the literal alpha-numeric
  pattern), but always includes the identifier scheme identity in its criteria.</p>
<p>Class implementation inheritance will be used to inherit support for validation of well-formedness. This support is largely independent of the interface hierarchy
  of applicability. In a high abstract super class, we support validation using grep patterns. Lower more specific abstract subclasses, with the help of static helper
  methods and delegates, will implement support for more stringent validation, such as CRC checks, which are embedded in many identifier schemes.</p>
<p>Although some different identifier schemes might be syntactically the same, still different concrete classes will be created for each scheme. This includes
  different version of one identifier scheme: these are essentially different schemes. Common behavior can be exploited via implementation inheritance or
  delegation.</p>
<p>The programmatic representation, persistent storage, and interaction with the user, will always carry the complete identifier string. Non-identifying parts, such
  as CRC fields, will <em>not</em> be filtered out of the programmatic representation, or out of the end user presentation.</p>
<p>A concrete identifier class is bound to exactly one well-defined identifier scheme. There might be more than one implementation for one given identifier scheme.
  As such, given an identifier object, we know exactly of which identifier scheme it is an instance, via the class it is an instance of. All identifier classes
  feature a dynamic method that return a programmatic representation of the identifier scheme for which it is the implementation. We choose to use the FQCN of the
  class for this, via <code><var>identifier</var>.getClass().getCanonicalName()</code>. This information is stored and transported with the actual identifier in
  all circumstances. Notably, when we store an identifier in a database, apart from the VARCHAR column holding the identifier String, we also store this
  identifier scheme identification in a second VARCHAR column.</p>
<p>A URL where a formal description of the identifier scheme (preferably in English) can be found is provided for each identifier class in an annotation. A description
  of the identifier type, aimed at developers, its applicability, and a reference to the issuing authority, is part of the Javadoc of the class.</p>
<p>For each interface, created for a domain of applicability of identifiers, a list is created in a file that <dfn>enumerates</dfn> all known implementations.
  This list only enumerates the delta with a super type, but also lists all known sub interfaces. This list is provided in each library, and is found via default
  names, but can be extended or replaced when it is used. Support is offered to use these lists in a UI, to enable the end user to select the identifier scheme he
  wants.</p>
<p>Localized concise names for each identifier scheme are needed. They are provided via separate properties files.</p>
