/**
 * <p>Support for reasoning about relations between time points and time intervals, and constraints on those
 *   relationships. <strong>We strongly advise to use this class when working with relations between time
 *   points and time intervals. Reasoning about relations between time points and time intervals is
 *   treacherously difficult.</strong></p>
 * <p>When working with time points and time intervals, we often want to express constraints (invariants)
 *   that limit acceptable combinations. Expressing this correctly proves extremely difficult in practice.
 *   Falling back to working with isolated begin and end dates, and reasoning about their relations with
 *   the time point, in practice proves to be even much more difficult and error prone.</p>
 * <p>This class is developed following the example of {@link TimeIntervalRelation Allen relations}.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Quick overview</h3>
 * <p>We find that there are 5 <em>basic relations</em> possible between a point in time and a definite time
 *   interval:</p>
 * <table>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td><code><var>t</var> {@link #BEFORE} <var>I</var></code></td>
 *     <td><img src="doc-files/TimePointIntervalRelation-before.png" width="296" /></td>
 *     <td><b>&lt;</b></td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td><code><var>t</var> {@link #BEGINS} <var>I</var></code></td>
 *     <td><img src="doc-files/TimePointIntervalRelation-begins.png" width="296" /></td>
 *     <td><b>=[&lt;</b></td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td><code><var>t</var> {@link #IN} <var>I</var></code></td>
 *     <td><img src="doc-files/TimePointIntervalRelation-in.png" width="296" /></td>
 *     <td><b>&gt;&lt;</b></td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td><code><var>t</var> {@link #ENDS} <var>I</var></code></td>
 *     <td><img src="doc-files/TimePointIntervalRelation-ends.png" width="296" /></td>
 *     <td><b>=[&gt;</b></td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td><code><var>t</var> {@link #AFTER} <var>I</var></code></td>
 *     <td><img src="doc-files/TimePointIntervalRelation-after.png" width="296" /></td>
 *     <td><b>&gt;</b></td>
 *   </tr>
 * </table>
 * <p>These basic relations can be compared to <code>&lt;</code>, <code>==</code> and <code>></code>
 *   with time instances.</p>
 * <p>When reasoning about the relationship between time intervals however, like when comparing time instances,
 *   we also often employ indeterminate relations, such as
 *   <code><var>t</var> ({@link #BEFORE} || {@link #BEGINS}) <var>I</var></code>. This is comparable to
 *   reasoning with <code>&le;</code>, <code>&ge;</code> and <code>!=</code> with time instances.
 *   For time intervals, given 5 basic relations, we get 32 (== 2<sup>5</sup>) possible <em>general
 *   relations</em>. This includes the {@link #EMPTY empty relationship} for algebraic reasons, and the
 *   {@link #FULL full relationship} (comparable to <code>&lt; || == || &gt;</code> with time instances),
 *   which expresses the maximal uncertainty about the relation between a point in time and time intervals.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Interval constraints</h3>
 * <p>Time point-interval relations will most often be used in business code to constrain relations between
 *  time points and time intervals.
 *  This is notoriously, treacherously difficult. It is for this reason that you should use code like this,
 *  that at least forces you to think things trough, and tries to offers tools to ease reasoning. The idiom
 *  todo this is explained next.</p>
 * <p>First we need to determine the relation we want to uphold (<code><var>cond</var></code>). E.g., we want
 *  to assert that given a point in time <code><var>t</var></code> does not fall before a time interval
 *  <code><var>I</var></code> is fully started. The relationship that expresses this is
 *  <code><var>cond</var> == {@link #or}({@link #BEFORE}, {@link #BEGINS})</code>.</p>
 * <p>Next, we want to determine the relationship between <code><var>t</var></code> and <code><var>I</var></code>
 *  as precisely as possible. If <code><var>I</var></code> is completely determined, i.e., neither its begin date
 *  nor its end date is {@code null}, the result will be a {@link #BASIC_RELATIONS basic relation}. Otherwise,
 *  the result will be a less certain relation. To determine this relationship, use
 *  {@link #timePointIntervalRelation(Date, TimeInterval)}. See below for dealing with constrained begin and end
 *  dates.</p>
 * <p>The idiom for the assertion we want to express is then:</p>
 * <pre>
 *   timePointIntervalRelation(<var>t</var>, <var>I</var>).implies(<var>cond</var>)
 * </pre>
 * <p>This is often the form of an invariant. Note that this can fail, on the one hand because the actual
 *   relation is not acceptable, but also because <em>we cannot be 100% sure that the actual relationship
 *   satisfies the condition</em>. In our example, we would have:</p>
 * <pre>
 *   timePointIntervalRelation(<var>t</var>, <var>I</var>).implies(or(BEFORE, BEGINS))
 * </pre>
 * <p><code>or(BEFORE, BEGINS) = (&lt;, =[&lt;)</code>. If the actual relation results in {@code (&gt;&lt;)}, e.g.,
 *  the constraint is clearly not satisfied. If the actual relation results in {@code (=[&lt; &gt;&lt;)} for example,
 *  it means that it is possible that the relation is satisfied, but there is also a chance that it is not.</p>
 * <p>In code then, we often want to throw an exception to interrupt an algorithm that would violate the
 *   invariant. The idiom for this is usually of the form:</p>
 * <pre>
 *   ...
 *   Date t = ...;
 *   TimeInterval i = ...;
 *   TimePointIntervalRelation condition = ...;
 *   TimePointIntervalRelation actual = timePointIntervalRelation(t, i);
 *   if (! actual.implies(condition)) {
 *     throw new ....
 *   }
 *   ...
 * </pre>
 * <p>In our example, this would become</p>
 * <pre>
 *   ...
 *   Date t = ...;
 *   TimeInterval i = ...;
 *   if (! timePointIntervalRelation(t, i).implies(or(BEFORE, BEGINS)) {
 *     throw new ....
 *   }
 *   ...
 * </pre>
 * <p><strong>Note that in general {@code (! actual.implies(condition))} is <em>not equivalent</em> with
 *   {@code actual.implies(condition.complement())} (see {@link #complement()}).</strong> In our example
 *   this is already clear. If the actual relation results in {@code (&gt;&lt;)},
 *   {@code ! timePointIntervalRelation(t, i).implies(or(BEFORE, BEGINS))} evaluates to</p>
 * <pre>
 *    ! timePointIntervalRelation(t, i).implies(or(BEFORE, BEGINS))
 * == ! (&gt;&lt;).implies((&lt; ==[&lt;))
 * == ! false
 * == true
 * </pre>
 * <p>and {@code timePointIntervalRelation(t, i).implies(or(BEFORE, BEGINS).complement())} evaluates to</p>
 * <pre>
 *    timePointIntervalRelation(t, i).implies(or(BEFORE, BEGINS).complement())
 * == (&gt;&lt;).implies((&lt; &lt[).complement())
 * == (&gt;&lt;).implies((&gt;&lt; =[&gt; &gt;))
 * == true
 * </pre>
 * <p>But in the case where the actual relation results in {@code (=[&lt; &gt;&lt;)},
 *   {@code ! timePointIntervalRelation(t, i).implies(or(BEFORE, BEGINS))} evaluates to</p>
 * <pre>
 *    ! timePointIntervalRelation(t, i).implies(or(BEFORE, BEGINS))
 * == ! (=[&lt; &gt;&lt;).implies((&lt; ==[&lt;))
 * == ! false
 * == true
 * </pre>
 * <p>and {@code timePointIntervalRelation(t, i).implies(or(BEFORE, BEGINS).complement())} evaluates to</p>
 * <pre>
 *    timePointIntervalRelation(t, i).implies(or(BEFORE, BEGINS).complement())
 * == (=[&lt; &gt;&lt;).implies((&lt; ==[&lt;).complement())
 * == (=[&lt; &gt;&lt;).implies((&gt;&lt; =[&gt; &gt;))
 * == <strong>false</strong>
 * </pre>
 * <p>{@code ! timePointIntervalRelation(t, i).implies(or(BEFORE, BEGINS))} expresses that [we want to throw an
 *   exception if] <em>it is not guaranteed that <code><var>t</var></code> is before <code><var>i</var></code> is
 *   fully started. {@code timePointIntervalRelation(t, i).implies(or(BEFORE, BEGINS).complement())} expresses
 *   that [we want to throw an exception if] <em>it is guaranteed that <code><var>t</var></code> is after
 *   <code><var>i</var></code> is fully started. <strong>These 2 phrases are not equivalent.</strong>
 *   Consider a {@code null} begin for <code><var>i</var></code>. When <code><var>t</var></code> is before the
 *   end of <code><var>i</var></code>, we cannot know whether <code><var>t</var></code> is before,
 *   equal to, or after the begin of <code><var>i</var></code>.
 *   With {@code ! timePointIntervalRelation(t, i).implies(or(BEFORE, BEGINS))} we will throw an exception,
 *   with {@code timePointIntervalRelation(t, i).implies(or(BEFORE, BEGINS).complement())} we would not.</p>
 *
 *
 * MUDO LOWER NOT FINISHED
 *
 * <h3 id="constrainedDates">Reasoning with unknown but constrained begin and end dates</h3>
 * <p>In time intervals, the begin or end end can be {@code null}. The semantics of this is in general that
 *  the begin date, respectively the end date, is unknown. Comparing such an interval with a point in time
 *  results in a relatively broad time point-interval relation, expressing an amount of uncertainty.</p>
 * <p>In several use cases however, we do not know a definite begin or end date, but we do know that the
 *  begin or end date have constraints. E.g., consider contracts that have a definite begin date, but are
 *  open ended. The contract interval thus is incompletely known. However, since at the moment of our reasoning
 *  no definite end date is set, we know that the end date is at least later than {@code now}. In comparing
 *  this contract interval with another interval, this constraint can be of use to limit the extend, i.e., the
 *  uncertainty, of the time point-interval relation. The same applies, e.g., with contracts that will start once payment is
 *  received. Since it is not received yet at the moment of our evaluation, we know that the begin date is at
 *  least later than or equal to {@code now}.</p>
 * <p>In such cases, the interval object <code><var>I</var></code> we are focusing on can be interpreted in
 *  another way. Suppose we are comparing <code><var>I</var></code> with a point int time <code><var>t</var></code>.
 *  We are actually not interested in <code>timePointIntervalRelation(<var>t</var>, <var>I</var>)</code>, but rather in
 *  <code>timePointIntervalRelation(<var>t</var>, <var>I<sub>constrained</sub></var>)</code>. Sadly, there is no easy
 *  syntax (or code) to express <code><var>I<sub>constrained</sub></var></code>. What we can express is an
 *  <var>I<sub>determinate</sub></var>, where the border times are filled out in place of the unknown begin
 *  date or end date. <code>timePointIntervalRelation(<var>t</var>, <var>I<sub>determinate</sub></var>)</code>
 *  can be calculated, and will be much less uncertain than
 *  <code>timePointIntervalRelation(<var>t</var>, <var>I</var>)</code>. If we now can determine the Allen
 *  relation from <code><var>I<sub>determinate</sub></var></code> to <code><var>I<sub>constrained</sub></var></code> ,
 *  we can find <code>timePointIntervalRelation(<var>t</var>, <var>I<sub>constrained</sub></var>)</code> as:</p>
 * <pre>
 *   timePointIntervalRelation(<var>t</var>, <var>I<sub>constrained</sub></var>) ==
 *     compose(timePointIntervalRelation(<var>t</var>, <var>I<sub>determinate</sub></var>), allenRelation(<var>I<sub>determinate</sub></var>, <var>I<sub>constrained</sub></var>))
 * </pre>
 * <p>The time point-interval relation from an interval we are focusing on with constrained semantics to a determinate
 *   interval is a constant that can be determined by reasoning. E.g., for our open ended contract, that lasts
 *   at least longer than today (<code>[I<sub>begin</sub>, &gt; now[</code>, supposing <code>I<sub>begin</sub> &le;
 *   yesterday</code>), we can say that its relation to the determinate interval <code>[I<sub>begin</sub>, now[</code> is
 *   {@code (s)} ({@link TimeIntervalRelation#STARTS}). Suppose
 *   <code>timePointIntervalRelation(<var>t</var>, <var>I<sub>determinate</sub></var>) == (&gt;&lt;)</code> (say
 *   <code><var>t</var> == <var>yesterday</var></code>), we can now say
 *   that <code>timePointIntervalRelation(<var>t</var>, <var>I<sub>constrained</sub></var>) == (s).(&gt;&tl;) == (&gt;&lt;)</code>.
 *   The comparison of the indeterminate interval with <code><var>t</var></code>,
 *   <code>timePointIntervalRelation(<var>t</var>, <var>I</var>)</code>, would have resulted in:</p>
 * <pre>
 *    timePointIntervalRelation(<var>t</var>, <var>I</var>)
 * == timePointIntervalRelation(<var>yesterday</var>, [I<sub>begin</sub>, null[)
 * == (&gt;&lt; = [&gt; &gt;)
 * </pre>
 * <p>which is indeed the most certain answer.
 * <p>Be aware that in a number of cases, the non-determinate character of <code><var>I</var></code> doesn't matter.
 *   If you suppose in the previous example that
 *   <code>timePointIntervalRelation(<var>t</var>, <var>I<sub>determinate</sub></var>) == (&gt;)</code> (say
 *   <code><var>t</var> == <var>next year</var></code>),
 *   <code>timePointIntervalRelation(<var>t</var>, <var>I<sub>constrained</sub></var>) == (s).(&gt;) == (&gt;&lt; =[&gt; &gt;)</code>.
 *   The comparison of the indeterminate interval with <code><var>t</var></code>,
 *   <code>timePointIntervalRelation(<var>t</var>, <var>I</var>)</code>, in this case, results in the same time point-interval
 *   relation:</p>
 * <pre>
 *    timePointIntervalRelation(<var>t</var>, <var>I</var>)
 * == timePointIntervalRelation(<var>t</var>, [<var>I<sub>begin</sub></var>, null[)
 * == (&gt;&lt; =[&gt; &gt;)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>About the code</h3>
 * <p>We have chosen to introduce a full-featured type for working with time point-interval relations, to make encapsulation as
 *   good as possible. This has a slight performance overhead, but we believe that this is worth it, considering the
 *   immense complexity of reasoning about relations between time intervals.</p>
 * <p>Time point-interval relations are not implemented as a value according to the ppwcode value vernacular, although they do form
 *   an algebra. We presume time point-interval relations are never shown to end users as values.</p>
 * <p>Time point-interval relations follow the &quot;32-fold singleton pattern&quot;. All possible instances are created when this
 *   class is loaded, and it is impossible for a user of the class to create new instances. This means that reference
 *   equality (&quot;{@code ==}&quot;) can be used to compare time point-interval relations, Instances are to be obtained
 *   using the constants this class offers, or using the combination methods {@link #or(TimePointIntervalRelation...)},
 *   {@link #and(TimePointIntervalRelation...)}, {@link #compose(TimePointIntervalRelation, TimeIntervalRelation)}, and
 *   {@link #min(TimePointIntervalRelation, TimePointIntervalRelation)}, and the unary method {@link #complement()}.
 *   Also, an TimePointIntervalRelation can be determined {@link #timePointIntervalRelation(Date, TimeInterval) based on a point
 *   in time and a time interval}.
 *   {@link #VALUES} lists all possible time point-interval relations.</p>
 * <p>The {@link Object#equals(Object)} is not overridden, because we want to use this type with reference equality.
 *   {@link #hashCode()} is overridden nevertheless, to guarantee a better spread (it also happens to give a peek inside
 *   the encapsulation, for people who know the implementation details).</p>
 * <p>All methods in this class are O(n), i.e., work in constant time, although {@link #compose(TimePointIntervalRelation, TimeIntervalRelation)}
 *   takes a significant longer constant time than the other methods.

   * <p>The complement of an time point-interval relation is the logic negation of the condition the time point-interval relation expresses.
   *   The complement of a basic time point-interval relation is the disjunction of all the other basic time point-interval relations.
   *   The complement of a general time point-interval relation is the disjunction of all basic time point-interval relations that are
   *   not implied by the general time point-interval relation.</p>
   * <p>This method is key to validating semantic constraints on time intervals, using the following idiom:</p>
   * <pre>
   *   ...
   *   Date t1 = ...;
   *   Date t2 = ...;
   *   TimePointIntervalRelation condition = ...;
   *   TimePointIntervalRelation actual = timePointIntervalRelation(t1, t2);
   *   if (! actual.implies(condition)) {
   *     throw new ....
   *   }
   *   ...
   * </pre>
   * <p><strong>Be aware that the complement has in general not the same meaning as a logic negation.</strong>
   *   For a basic relation <var>br</var> and a general time point-interval relation <var>cond</var>, it is true that</p>
   * <p><code><var>br</var>.implies(<var>cond</var>)</code> &hArr;
   *   <code>! <var>br</var>.implies(<var>cond</var>.complement())</code></p>
   * <p><strong>This is however not so for non-basic, and thus general time point-interval relations</strong>, as the following
   *   counterexample proofs. Suppose a condition is that, for a general relation <var>gr</var>:</p>
   * <pre><var>gr</var>.implies(<var>cond</var>)</pre>
   * <p>Suppose <code><var>gr</var> == (=[&lt; &gt;&lt;)</code>. Then we can rewrite in the following way:</p>
   * <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code><var>gr</var>.implies(<var>cond</var>)</code><br />
   *   &hArr; <code>(=[&lt; &gt;&lt;).implies(<var>cond</var>)</code><br />
   *   &hArr; <code>(=[&lt; &gt;&lt;) &sube; <var>cond</var></code><br />
   *   &hArr; <code>(=[&lt; &isin; <var>cond</var>) && (&gt;&lt; &isin; <var>cond</var>)</code></p>
   * <p>From the definition of the complement, it follows that, for a basic relation <var>br</var> and a general
   *   relation <var>GR</var> as set</p>
   * <p><code>br &isin; GR</code> &hArr; <code>br &notin; GR.complement()</code></p>
   * <p>Thus:</p>
   * <p>&hArr; <code>(=[&lt; &notin; <var>cond</var>.complement()) && (&gt;&lt; &notin; <var>cond</var>.complement())<br />
   *   &hArr; <code>! ((=[&lt; &isin; <var>cond</var>.complement()) || (&gt;&lt; &isin; <var>cond</var>.complement()) (1)</p>
   * <p>While, from the other side:</p>
   * <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>! <var>gr</var>.implies(<var>cond</var>.complement())</code><br />
   *   &hArr; <code>! (=[&lt; &gt;&lt;).implies(<var>cond</var>.complement())</code><br />
   *   &hArr; <code>! (=[&lt; &gt;&lt;) &sube; (<var>cond</var>.complement())</code><br />
   *   &hArr; <code>! ((=[&lt; &isin; <var>cond</var>.complement()) && (&gt;&lt; &isin; <var>cond</var>.complement()) (2)</p>
   * <p>It is clear that (1) is incompatible with (2), except for the case where the initial relation is basic.</p>
   * <p>In the reverse case, for a basic relation <var>br</var> and a general time point-interval relation <var>actual</var>, nothing
   *   special can be said about the complement of <var>actual</var>, as the following reasoning illustrates:</p>
   * <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code><var>actual</var>.implies(<var>br</var>)</code><br />
   *   &hArr;<code><var>actual</var> &sube; <var>br</var></code><br />
   *   &hArr;<code><var>actual</var> &sube; (<var>br</var>)</code><br />
   *   &hArr;<code><var>actual</var> == (<var>br</var>) || <var>actual</var> == &empty;</code><br />
   *   &hArr;<code><var>actual</var>.complement() == (<var>br</var>).complement() || <var>actual</var>.complement() == FULL</code> (3)</p>
   * <p>From the other side:</p>
   * <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>! <var>actual</var>.complement().implies(<var>br</var>)</code><br />
   *   &hArr;<code>! (<var>actual</var>.complement() &sube; <var>br</var>)</code><br />
   *   &hArr;<code>! (<var>actual</var>.complement() &sube; (<var>br</var>))</code><br />
   *   &hArr;<code>! (<var>actual</var>.complement() == (<var>br</var>) || <var>actual</var>.complement() == &empty;)</code><br />
   *   &hArr;<code><var>actual</var>.complement() != (<var>br</var>) && <var>actual</var>.complement() != &empty;</code> (4)</p>
   * <p>It is clear that (3) expresses something completely different then (4), and this effect is obviously even stronger with
   *   non-basic relations.</p>
   * <p>Note that it is exactly this counter-intuitivity that makes reasoning with time intervals so difficult.</p>
