/**
 * <p>A time interval is a duration between 2 points in time. <strong>Time in general, and intervals in particular,
 *   are treacherously difficult to reason a about. Beware.</strong> Experience shows that falling back to
 *   the begin and end dates as separated dates and reasoning about them does not solve the complexity, and results
 *   in even more difficult reasonings and is even more error prone.</p>
 * <p><em>We strongly suggest that you use {@link AllenRelation} for reasoning about time intervals.</em></p>
 * <p>For time intervals, we impose a few choices that, in our experience, are good choices.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Interval</h3>
 * <p>We choose for all time intervals to express <em>half, right-open</em> time intervals. A consistent half-open
 *   interval helps in avoiding awkward border conditions. We have chosen to always use half, <em>right</em>-open
 *   intervals for several reasons, stemming from philosophy, the similarity between limitations in physics due to
 *   the finite speed of light and processing and remote communication, the similarity between the impossibility to
 *   express simultaneity of events in physics due to relativity (see
 *   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/About-Time-Einsteins-Unfinished-Revolution/dp/0684818221/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1224448626&amp;sr=1-1">About
 *   Time: Einstein's Unfinished Revolution; <cite>Paul Davies</cite></a>) and the drift of clocks in different
 *   computers in distributed systems, and other half-baked (or half-drunk) reflections. If you bring a bottle, we
 *   can talk about this.<p>
 *
 * <h3>Three properties and incomplete data</h3>
 * <p>A time interval has a {@link #getBegin() begin time}, an {@link #getEnd() end time}, and a
 *   {@link #getDuration() duration}, which are interrelated. The interface does not define which of the 2 of those
 *   3 should be stored, and which should be calculated.</p>
 * <p>The begin date, the end date and the duration can be {@code null}. The semantics of this is to be defined by
 *   the user case by case. We often encounter the use case of open-ended time intervals: an employment spans a time
 *   interval of time, but during most of that time interval, only the begin time is known. In such cases, a
 *   mandatory begin date, and an unknown end date and duration is used, until the end date is decided on. How to deal
 *   with unknown or constrained begin and end times is described in {@link AllenRelation}.</p>
 * <p>When one basic property is {@code null}, there can be no calculations, and the derived property will be
 *   {@code null} also.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Implementations</h3>
 * <p>This package offers many subtypes of {@code TimeInterval}. We believe it is, in this case, more appropriate to
 *   introduce different subtypes for different constraints on time intervals, instead of limiting a general time
 *   interval implementation in the use code. This way, we can add specialized user interfaces, Hibernate user types,
 *   JPA value handlers, etcetera, that are tweaked to specific constraints. E.g., a time interval that uses days as
 *   a time quant, will have a simpler user interface than a time interval that needs a user interface that is precise
 *   to the millisecond.</p>
 * <p>Since this is an {@link ImmutableValue}, implementations should offer a good public constructor, and should
 *   be declared {@code final}.
