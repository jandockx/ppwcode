	<comment>Business logic of Client Contracts @ HDP. This version is a stub,
               with minimal functionality needed for Jethro (AristA RIM). Potentially,
               this version will grow to be the contract system for HDP.
               In this stub version, the enterprise management is included. In the master
               plan, this should become a separate HDP level project.</comment>
